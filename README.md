# SVM_FaeRecognition

SVM - Support Vector Machines
- A supervised machine learning model used for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model set of labeled training data for each category, theyâ€™re able to categorize new test data.SVM classifies data based on the plane that maximizes the margin. The SVM decision boundary is straight. SVM is a really good algorithm for image classification. Experimental results show that SVMs achieve significantly higher search accuracy than traditional query refinement schemes after just three to four rounds of relevance feedback. This is also true for image segmentation systems, including those using a modified version SVM that uses the privileged approach.

This can be directly implemented in google colab or if you want to use this on your local machine then creating a virtual environment is preferred.

For local machines:

Dependencies :

Get these Libraries:
Pylab, Numpy , Matplotlib , Sklearn .

Then you can go through the code for the implementation .

(The following code example is taken from the sklearn documentation on eigenfaces.
